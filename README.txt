# Mini Movie Explorer (Static Mockup)

This is a static mockup version of the **Mini Movie Explorer** assignment.
It is created using only **HTML** and **CSS** (no JavaScript or React) because I am currently focusing on Java Full Stack technologies and still learning frontend development.
I am comfortable with HTML and CSS, but not yet with the advanced technologies required for this assignment. I would love to contribute to such projects in the future once I build the necessary skills.
Currently, I am pursuing **Java Full Stack training** from QSpiders.
