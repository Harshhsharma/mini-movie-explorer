Mini Movie Explorer (Static Mockup)

This is a static mockup version of the Mini Movie Explorer assignment.
It is created using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript or React) because I am currently focusing on Java Full Stack technologies and still learning frontend development.

Features:
- Search bar (non-functional, static)
- Sample movie results (dummy data with local images)
- Dummy watchlist section
- Responsive layout (basic)

Images used in the 'images' folder are for demo purposes.
